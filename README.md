## Getting Started

First, you will need to clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/jest-intro-workshop.git
```

Then, you will have to install all the dependencies with npm:

```bash
$ npm install
```

And jest globally so that you can run it from the terminal:

```bash
$ npm install --global jest
```

## Contents and Branches Naming Strategy

The repository is made up of several branches that include the contents and exercises of each section.

The branches follow a naming strategy like the following:

- `{NN}-exercise`: includes the main contents and the instructions of the exercises
- `{NN}-exercise-solution`: includes the solution of the exercises

## What is Jest?

Jest is an amazing testing library created by Facebook to help test JavaScript code.

| Jest aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects. | Make tests which keep track of large objects with ease. Snapshots live either alongside your tests, or embedded inline. | Tests are parallelized by running them in their own processes to maximize performance. | From it to expect - Jest has the entire toolkit in one place. Well documented, well maintained, well good. |

## Writing Your First Test

A test is made up of a test name and a callback function that contains our assertions about our code.

Open the `demo.test.js` file inside the `src/__tests__` folder, write the following test and execute in the terminal the following command: `jest -t "1 is 1"`.

Make sure that jest is installed globally by following the steps in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) part of the readme.

```js
test("1 is 1", function () {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

If everything went fine you should have your first passing test 🎉

```bash
$ jest -t "1 is 1"
PASS  src/__tests__/demo.test.js

Test Suites: 1 skipped, 1 passed, 1 of 2 total
Tests:       1 skipped, 1 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.954 s, estimated 6 s
Ran all test suites with tests matching "1 is 1".
```

### `test` and `it`

In order to write a test we use the `test(“”, () => {})` method which takes in a test name and a function (`test()` is also aliased as `it()`). Then, inside the callback function we executing any assertions that we want to make about our code.

```js
test("1 is 1", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});

// it() is an alias for test()
it("compares 1 to 1", () => {
  // We assert that 1 is 1
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

### Skipping Tests

If you have many tests and you only want to run only some of them, you can use the modifiers that Jest provides.

For this exercise you should open the `modifiers.test.js` file, add the `.only` or `.skip` modifiers after the second test and run in the terminal the following command: `jest modifiers.test.js`

```js
test("1 is 1", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});

// Only executes this test
test.only("2 is not 1", () => {
  expect(2).not.toBe(1);
});

test("true is true", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
jest modifiers.test.js
PASS  src/__tests__/modifiers.test.js
 ✓ 2 is not 1 (2 ms)
 ○ skipped 1 is 1
 ○ skipped true is true

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 skipped, 1 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.741 s, estimated 2 s
Ran all test suites matching /modifiers.test.js/i.
```

### Grouping Tests

Sometimes you might have tests that are related or are targeting the same feature of your app. For these cases (and more), you can create a test suite using the Jest `describe` blocks. `describe` blocks can also use the `.skip` or `.only` modifiers.

For this exercise you should execute in the terminal the following command `jest -t "testing numbers"` to execute the first test suite or `jest -t "testing booleans"` to run the second test suite from the `test-suites.test.js` file in the `src/__tests__/` folder.

```js
describe("testing numbers", () => {
  test("1 is 1", () => {
    expect(1).toBe(1);
  });

  test("1 is not 2", () => {
    expect(1).not.toBe(2);
  });
});

describe("testing booleans", () => {
  test("true is true", () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Running Tests From The Command Line

We can run tests once we have installed Jest using the command line. If we want to find tests based on the **file name** we can do it this way:

```bash
# if we have a file: `test-file-name.test.js`
# we can use the following command to execute it:
$ jest test-file-name.test.js

# or
$ jest test-file

# if there are several files that start with that
# file name, jest will run all of them
$ jest t
```

If we want to find tests based on the **test name** we can do it this way to run the tests in the `test-suites.test.js` file:

```bash
# this will execute all the tests or describe
# blocks that have a name that contains the name
$ jest -t "testing booleans"

$ jest -t "true is true"
```

### Running Tests From NPM Scripts

We can also execute jest as an npm script in our `package.json` file so that it runs all the tests in our app. Additionally, we can pass the `--watchAll` flag which will execute the tests each time we make a change.

```json
"scripts": {
   "test": "jest --watchAll"
 }
```

## Jest File Naming Conventions

By default, Jest will look for tests in a folder named `__tests__` that contains files named `*.spec.js` or `*.test.js`.

The pattern that Jest uses to find test files by default is:

```js
["**/__tests__/**/*.[jt]s?(x)", "**/?(*.)+(spec|test).[jt]s?(x)"];
```

### Where To Place Test Files?

Tests files should be placed near to the feature we are trying to test inside a `__tests__` folder using the naming conventions explained before.

Tests should be collocated with each feature or part of our app. This way, all the files will be together, both the feature code and the tests.

```bash
src/utils
├── __tests__
│   └── numbers.test.js
└── numbers.js
```

## Matchers

Jest uses _matchers_ to let you test values in different ways.

You can test simple values such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, or even functions to see how they have been called and with what arguments.

### Basic Matcher Example

A basic example of a matcher usage in Jest is to test if a value is equal to another value by using the `.toBe()` matcher.

```js
test("1 is 1", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

### 01-exercise

Open the `01-exercise.test.js` file inside the `src/__tests__/` folder and solve the exercise by following the instructions. Then, you can check if your solution is correct by running `jest` from the terminal and passsing in the test suite name: `01-exercise`.

Example: `jest -t "01-exercise"`

For this part you have 10 minutes to solve it. If you get stuck you can find the solution inside the `01-exercise-solution` branch. Once the time has passed the instructor will solve the exercise.

### `.toBe()`

One of the most common matchers in Jest is the `.toBe()` matcher. It is similar to `===` as it returns `true` if primitive values are the same and for references types if the point to the same object/array/function.

```js
test("toBe tests", () => {
  const obj = { name: "Ana" };
  const objCopy = obj;

  expect(1).toBe(1); // ✅
  expect(1).not.toBe(2); // ✅
  expect("name").toBe("name"); // ✅
  expect(obj).toBe(objCopy); // ✅
  expect(obj).not.toBe({ name: "Ana" }); // ✅
});
```

### 02-exercises

Open the `02-exercise.test.js` file inside the `src/__tests__/` folder and solve the exercise by following the instructions. Then, you can check if your solution is correct by running `jest` from the terminal and passsing in the test suite name: `02-exercises`.

Example: `jest -t "02-exercises"`

For this part you have 10 minutes to solve it. If you get stuck you can find the solution inside the `02-exercise-solution` branch. Once the time has passed the instructor will solve the exercise.

### `.toEqual()`

Using `.toEqual()` we can recursively check every field of an object or array in a way that `.toBe()` doesn’t work.

```js
test("toEqual tests", () => {
  const obj = {
    firstName: "Ana",
    lastName: "Mark",
    age: 25,
    jobTitle: "developer",
  };

  const objCopy = obj;

  expect(1).toEqual(1); // ✅

  expect(obj).toEqual(objCopy); // ✅

  expect(obj).toEqual({
    firstName: "Ana",
    lastName: "Mark",
    age: 25,
    jobTitle: "developer",
  }); // ✅
});
```

### 03-exercises

Open the `03-exercise.test.js` file inside the `src/__tests__/` folder and solve the exercise by following the instructions. Then, you can check if your solution is correct by running `jest` from the terminal and passsing in the test suite name: `03-exercises`.

Example: `jest -t "03-exercises"`

For this part you have 10 minutes to solve it. If you get stuck you can find the solution inside the `03-exercise-solution` branch. Once the time has passed the instructor will solve the exercise.

### Truthiness

In tests, you sometimes need to distinguish between `undefined`, `null`, and `false`, but you sometimes do not want to treat these differently. Jest contains helpers that let you be explicit about what you want.

```js
test("null", () => {
  const value = null;

  expect(value).toBeNull();
  expect(value).toBeDefined();
  expect(value).not.toBeUndefined();
  expect(value).not.toBeTruthy();
  expect(value).toBeFalsy();
});
```

### Numbers

Jest also allows us to test number values in many ways.

```js
test("two plus two", () => {
  const result = 2 + 2;

  expect(result).toBeGreaterThan(3);
  expect(result).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3.5);
  expect(result).toBeLessThan(5);
  expect(result).toBeLessThanOrEqual(4.5);

  // toBe and toEqual are equivalent for numbers
  expect(result).toBe(4);
  expect(result).toEqual(4);
});
```

### Strings

You can check strings against regular expressions with `.toMatch()`.

```js
test("there is no I in team", () => {
  expect("team").not.toMatch(/I/);
});

test('but there is a "stop" in Christoph', () => {
  expect("Christoph").toMatch(/stop/);
});
```

### 04-exercises

Open the `04-exercise.test.js` file inside the `src/__tests__/` folder and solve the exercise by following the instructions. Then, you can check if your solution is correct by running `jest` from the terminal and passsing in the test suite name: `04-exercises`.

Example: `jest -t "04-exercises"`

For this part you have 10 minutes to solve it. If you get stuck you can find the solution inside the `04-exercise-solution` branch. Once the time has passed the instructor will solve the exercise.

### Matching Array Values

You can use `.toContain()` when you want to check if an array contains an element.

```js
test("array contains the element", () => {
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

  expect(numbers).toContain(3);
});
```

### Arrays That Contain Objects

You can use `.toContainEqual()` when you want to check that an item with a specific structure and values is contained in an array. This matcher recursively checks the equality of all fields, rather than checking for object identity.

```js
test("array contains the object", () => {
  const users = [
    {
      name: "Alex",
    },
    {
      name: "Ana",
    },
    {
      name: "John",
    },
  ];

  expect(users).toContainEqual({
    name: "John",
  });
});
```

### Sub-matching Array Values

You can use `.arrayContaining()` when you want to check if an array contains another array, that is, the expected array is a subset of the received array.

```js
describe("arrayContaining", () => {
  it("matches the elements in the array", () => {
    expect(["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]).toEqual(
      expect.arrayContaining(["Alice", "Bob"])
    );
  });

  it("does not match", () => {
    expect(["Bob", "Eve"]).not.toEqual(
      expect.arrayContaining(["Alice", "Bob"])
    );
  });
});
```

### Sub-matching Objects Properties

`expect.objectContaining(object)` matches any received object that recursively matches the expected properties. That is, the expected object is a subset of the received object. Therefore, it matches a received object which contains properties that are present in the expected object.

```js
describe("objectContaining", () => {
  const obj = {
    lastName: "Mark",
    age: 25,
  };

  it("matches elements in the object", () => {
    expect(obj).toEqual(
      expect.objectContaining({
        lastName: "Mark",
      })
    );
  });

  it("does not match", () => {
    expect(obj).not.toEqual(
      expect.objectContaining({
        lastName: "Mark",
        since: "2018/05/02",
      })
    );
  });
});
```

### 05-exercises

Open the `05-exercise.test.js` file inside the `src/__tests__/` folder and solve the exercise by following the instructions. Then, you can check if your solution is correct by running `jest` from the terminal and passsing in the test suite name: `05-exercises`.

Example: `jest -t "05-exercises"`

For this part you have 10 minutes to solve it. If you get stuck you can find the solution inside the `05-exercise-solution` branch. Once the time has passed the instructor will solve the exercise.

## Testing Async Code

One of the most common tasks you will have will be to test async code that when it is finished, it executes a callback function that we provide.

```js
function someAction(callback) {
   // perform some async action

   // call the callback when done
   setTimeout(() => {
       callback(2);
   }, 100);
}

test("someAction returns 1", () => {
   someAction(function (result) {
       expect(result).toBe(1);
   });
});

// The test passed even if the result is not 1
PASS  __tests__/t-5.test.js
  ✓ someAction returns 1 (1 ms)
```

### Testing Async Code The Right Way

In order to fix this issue we need to use the parameter that our test callback function receives from jest (which is usually named `done`). Now, Jest will wait until the `done` callback is called before finishing the test and if `done()` is never called, the test will fail (with timeout error), which is what you want to happen.

```js
function someAction(callback) {
   // perform some async action

   // call the callback when done
   setTimeout(() => {
       callback(2);
   }, 100);
}

test("someAction returns 1", (done) => {
   someAction(function (result) {
       expect(result).toBe(1);
       // Jest will wait until the done callback is called
       // before finishing the test
       done();
   });
});

// ✅ Now the test fails because the result is not 1
 FAIL  __tests__/t-5.test.js
  ✕ someAction returns 1 (145 ms)
```

### Testing Promises

If your code uses promises, there is a more straightforward way to handle asynchronous tests. Return a promise from your test, and Jest will wait for that promise to resolve. If the promise is rejected, the test will automatically fail.

```js
function someAction() {
  return Promise.resolve({
    name: "Ana",
  });
}

test("someAction returns the user", () => {
  return someAction().then((user) => {
    expect(user.name).toBe("John");
  });
});

 FAIL  __tests__/t-6.test.js
 ✕ someAction returns the user (5 ms)
```

However, it is important that you return the promise, otherwise Jest will not wait for the promise to settle and it will miss the assertion.

```js
function someAction() {
   return Promise.resolve({
       name: "Ana",
   });
}

test("someAction returns the user", () => {
   // ❌ The test will not fail
   someAction().then((user) => {
       expect(user.name).toBe("John");
   });
});

PASS  __tests__/t-6.test.js
  ✓ someAction returns the user (6 ms)
```

### Testing a Failed Promise

If you want to test that a promise rejects in some case you can do it the following way.

```js
function getUser() {
   return Promise.reject("Nope");
}

test("getUser rejects", async () => {
   return expect(getUser()).rejects.toMatch(/Nope/);
});

PASS  __tests__/t-6.test.js
  ✓ getUser rejects (3 ms)
```

### Testing a Failed Promise Using `async`/`await`

If you want to test that a promise rejects in some case you can do it the following way using `async`/`await`.

```js
function getUser() {
   return Promise.reject("Nope");
}

test("getUser rejects", async () => {
   expect.assertions(1);

   try {
       await getUser();
   } catch (error) {
       expect(error).toMatch(/Nope/);
   }
});

PASS  __tests__/t-6.test.js
  ✓ getUser rejects (2 ms)
```

### 06-exercises

Open the `06-exercise.test.js` file inside the `src/__tests__/` folder and solve the exercise by following the instructions. Then, you can check if your solution is correct by running `jest` from the terminal and passsing in the test suite name: `06-exercises`.

Example: `jest -t "06-exercises"`

For this part you have 15 minutes to solve it. If you get stuck you can find the solution inside the `06-exercise-solution` branch. Once the time has passed the instructor will solve the exercise.
